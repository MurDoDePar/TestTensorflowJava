Training TensorFlow models in Java
Python is the primary language in which TensorFlow models are typically developed and trained. TensorFlow does have bindings for other programming languages. These bindings have the low-level primitives that are required to build a more complete API, however, lack much of the higher-level API richness of the Python bindings, particularly for defining the model structure.

This file demonstrates taking a model (a TensorFlow graph) created by a Python program and running the training loop in Java (and saving the trained weights to disk).

The model
The model is a trivial one, trying to learn the function: f(x) = W\*x + b, where W and b are model parameters. The training data is constructed so that the "true" value of W is 3 and that of b is 2, i.e., f(x) = 3 * x + 2.

Thus, over time, the predicted value for an input of 1, 2, and 3 should tend towards 5, 8, and 11.

Quickstart
Run the training loop program in Java using:

mvn compile exec:java -q -Dexec.args="graph.pb /tmp/checkpoint"
Where graph.pb is the serialized TenosrFlow graph and /tmp/checkpoint is the directory from which trained weights (the checkpoint) should be loaded (if available) and saved to (after training).

Generating the graph
The graph.pb file which contains the model definition, and the names of the tensors in it were generated by running python model.py.

Noteworthy
The Python APIs for TensorFlow include other conveniences for training (such as MonitoredSession and tf.train.Estimator), which make it easier to configure checkpointing, evaluation loops etc. The examples here aren't that sophisticated and are focused on basic model training only.
In this example, we use placeholders and feed dictionaries to feed input, but you probably want to use the tf.data API to cconstruct an input pipeline for providing training data to the model.
Not demonstrated here, but summaries for TensorBoard can also be produced by executing the summary operations.
